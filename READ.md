# 🚀 Leaderboard Management System

A distributed **Spring Boot Microservices** application that simulates an online coding platform with secure authentication, coding contests, code submissions, real-time leaderboard updates, and Redis caching.

The system is built using an **event-driven architecture** powered by **Apache Kafka**, with **Spring Cloud Gateway**, **Eureka Service Discovery**, **Redis**, **WebSocket**, **MySQL**, and **Docker**.

# 🎯 Design Principles

The project follows several software engineering best practices:

- SOLID Principles
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Separation of Concerns
- Layered Architecture
- Event-Driven Architecture
- RESTful API Design
- Dependency Injection
- DTO Pattern
- Repository Pattern

---

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 21
- Maven 3.9+
- Docker Desktop
- Git
- MySQL (only for local development without Docker)

---

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Leaderboard-Management-System.git

cd Leaderboard-Management-System
```

---

## Running Locally

### 1. Start Infrastructure

Run Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts:

- MySQL
- Redis
- Kafka

---

### 2. Start Eureka Server

```bash
cd eureka-server

mvn spring-boot:run
```

---

### 3. Start User Service

```bash
cd userservice

mvn spring-boot:run
```

---

### 4. Start Submission Service

```bash
cd submission-service

mvn spring-boot:run
```

---

### 5. Start Leaderboard Service

```bash
cd leaderboard-service

mvn spring-boot:run
```

---

### 6. Start API Gateway

```bash
cd api-gateway

mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application is now available at

```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

# 🐳 Running with Docker

Build all images

```bash
docker compose build
```

Start all containers

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

# 📚 API Documentation

Each microservice provides interactive Swagger documentation.

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| User Service | http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html |
| Submission Service | http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html |
| Leaderboard Service | http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui.html |

JWT authentication can be tested directly from Swagger using the **Authorize** button.

---

# 🧪 Testing

Run unit tests

```bash
mvn test
```

The project includes unit tests covering the service layer using:

- JUnit 5
- Mockito

---

# 📷 Screenshots
